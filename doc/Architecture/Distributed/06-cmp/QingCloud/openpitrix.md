- Deployed as one-stop-shop application management platform in an organization to support multiple cloud systems including hybrid cloud.
- Cloud management platform(CMP) can use OpenPitrix as a component to manage applications in multiple-cloud environment.
- Deployed as application management system in Kubernetes. OpenPitrix is different than Helm, OpenPitrix uses Helm under the hood though.
