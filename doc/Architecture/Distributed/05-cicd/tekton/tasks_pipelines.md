# Tasks and Pipelines

Building Blocks of Tekton CI/CD Workflow

## Tekton Pipelines

Tekton Pipelines is a Kubernetes extension that installs and runs on your Kubernetes cluster. It defines a set of Kubernetes Custom Resources that act as building blocks from which you can assemble CI/CD pipelines. Once installed, Tekton Pipelines becomes available via the Kubernetes CLI(kubectl) and via API calls, just like pods and other resources. Tekton is open-source and part of the CD Foundation, a Linux Foundation project.
