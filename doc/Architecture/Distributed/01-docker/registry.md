## Docker Registry

The Registry is a stateless, highly scalable server side application that stores and lets you distribute Docker images.

You should use the Registry if you want to:

- tightly control where your images are being stored
- fully own your images distribution pipeline
- integrate image storage and distribution tightly into your in-house development workflow
