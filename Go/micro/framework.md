# Framework

[framework](https://docs.m3o.com/concepts/framework)

## Overview

Micro addresses the key requirements for building distributed systems. It leverages the microservices architeture pattern and provides a set of services which act as the building blocks of a platform. Micro deals with the complexity of distributed systems and provides simpler programmable abstractions to build on.

## Features

Micro focuses on the concept of Development Runtime Infrastructure, creating separation between the varying concerns of development and infrastructure using a runtime as an abstraction layer, then providing entry points for external systems to access services run with Micro.

The framework is composed of the following features:

- **Server:** A distributed systems runtime composed of building block services which abstract away the underlying infrastructure and provide a programmable abstraction layer. Authentication, configruation, messaging, storage and more built in.

- **Clients:** Multiple entrypoints through which you can access your services. Write services once and access them through every means you've already come to know. A HTTP api, gRPC proxy and command line interface.

- **Library:** A Go library which makes it drop dead simple to write your services without having to piece together lines and lines of boilerplate. Auto configured and initialised by default, just import and get started quickly.

## Runtime Components

The runtime is composed of the following features:

### Clients

Clients are entrypoints into the system. They enable access to your service through well known entrypoints.

- **api:** An api gateway which acts as a single entry point for the frontend with dynamic request routing using service discovery.

- **cli:** Access services via the terminal. Every good developer tool needs a CLI as a defacto standard for operating a system.

- **proxy:** An identity aware proxy which allows you to access remote environments without painful configuration or vpn.

### Services

Services are the core services that makeup the runtime. They provide a programmable abstraction layer for distributed systems infrastructure.

- **auth:** Authentication and authorization is a core requirement for any production ready platform. Micro builds in an auth service for managing service to service and user to service authentication.

- **broker:** A message broker allowing for async messaging. Microservices are event driven architectures and should provide messaging as a first class citizen. Notify other services of events without needing to worry about a response.

- **config:** Manage dynamic config in a centralised location for your services to access. Has the ability to load config from multiple sources and enables you to update config without needing to restart services.

- **network:** A drop in service to service networking solution. Offload service discovery, load balancing and fault tolerance to the network. The micro network dynamically builds a latency based routing table based on the local registry. It includes support for multi-cloud networking.

- **registry:** The registry provides service discovery to locate other services, store feature rich metadata and endpoint information. It's a service explorer which lets you centrally and dynamically store this info at runtime.

- **runtime:** A service runtime which manages the lifecycle of your service, from source to running. The runtime service can run natively locally or on kubernetes, providing a seamless abstraction across both.

- **store:** State is a fundamental requirement of any system. We provide a key-value store to provide simple storage of state which can be shared between services or offload long term to keep microservices stateless and horizontally scalable.

## Service Library

Micro includes a pre-initialised service library built on the previously standalone library go-micro used for distributed systems development. Think Rails or Spring but for Go cloud services. Micro builds on the Go programming language to create a set of strongly defined abstractions for writing services.

Normally you'll spend a lot of time hacking a way at boilerplate code in your main function or battling with distributed systems design patterns. Micro tries to remove all of this pain for you and create simple building blocks all encapsulated in a single service interface.

Each service in the runtime has a corresponding package in **github.com/micro/micro/v3/service** which you can import and use for any need. If you want to publish a message use the broker. If you need to persist data use the store. Or if you just need to make service to service calls use the client.
