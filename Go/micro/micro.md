## Server

The micro server is a distributed system runtime for the Cloud and beyond. It provides the building blocks for distributed systems development as a set of services, command line and service framework. The server is much like a distributed operating system in the sense that each component runs independent of each other but work together as one system. This composition allows us to use a microservices architecture pattern even for the platform.

## Features

The server provides the below functionality as built in primitives for services development.

- Authentication
- Configuration
- PubSub Messaging
- Event Streaming
- Service Discovery
- Key-Value Storage
- HTTP API Gateway
- gRPC Identity Proxy

## Services

Micro is built as a distributed operating system leveraging the microservices architecture pattern.

### Overview

Below we describe the list of services provided by the Micro Server. Each service is considered a building block primitive for a platform and distributed systems development. The proto interfaces for each can be found in micro/proto/auth and the Go library, client and server implementation in micro/service/auth.

### API

The API service is a http API gateway which acts as a public entrypoint and converts http/json to RPC.

#### Overview

The micro API is the public entrypoint for all external access to be consumed by frontend, mobile, etc. The api accepts http/json requests and uses path based routing to resolve to backend services. It converts the request to gRPC and forward appropriately. The idea here is to focus on microservices on the backend and stitch everything togerther as a single API for the frontend.

### Auth

The auth service provides both authentication and authorization.

#### Overview

The auth service stores accounts and access rules. It provides the single source of truth for all authentication and authorization within the Micro runtime. Every service and user requires an account to operate. When a service is started by the runtime an account is generated for it. Core services and services run by Micro load rules periodically and manage the access to their resources on a per request basis.

### Broker

The broker is a message broker for asynchronous pubsub messaging.

#### Overview

The broker provides a simple abstraction for pubsub messaging. It focuses on simple semantics for fire-and-forget asynchronous communition. The goal here is to provide a pattern for async notifications where some update or events occurred but that does not require persistence. The client and server build in the ability to publish on one side and subscribe on the other. The broker provides no message ordering guarantees.

While a Service is normally called by name, messaging focuses on Topics that can have multiple publishers and subscribers. The broker is abstracting away in the service's client/server which includes message encoding/decoding so you don't have to spend all your time marshalling.

#### Client

The client contains the `Publish` method which takes a proto message, encodes it and publishes onto the broker on given topic. It takes the metadata from the client context and includes these as headers in the message including the content-type so the subscribe side knows how to deal with it.

#### Server

The server supports a `Subscribe` method which allows you to register a handler as you would for handling requests. In this way we can mirror the handler behaviour and deserialize the message when consuming from the broker. In this model the server handles connecting to the broker, subscribing, consuming and executing your subscriber function.

### Config

The config service provides dynamic configuration for services.

#### Overview

Config can be stored and loaded separately to the application itself for configuring business logic, api keys, etc. We read and write these as key-value pairs which also support nesting of JSON values. The config interface also supports storing secrets by defining the secret key as an option at the time of writing the value.

### Errors

The errors package provides error types for most common HTTP status code, e.g. BadRequest, InternalServerError etc. It's recommended when returning an error to an RPC handler, one of these errors is used. If any other type of error is returned, it's treated as an InternalServerError.

Micro API detects these error types and will use them to determine the response status code. For example, if your handler returns errors.BadRequest, the API will return a 400 status code. If no error is returned the API will return the default 200 status code.

Error codes are also used when handling retries. If your service returns a 500 (InternalServerError) or 408 (Timeout) then the client will retry the request. Other status codes are treated as client error and won't be retried.

### Events

The events service is a service for event streaming and persistent storage of events.

#### Overview

Event streaming differs from pubsub messaging in that it provides an ordered stream of events that can be consumed or replayed from any given point in the past. If you have experience with Kafka then you know it's basically a distribute log which allows you to read a file from different offsets and stream it.

The event service and interface provide the event streaming abstraction for writing and reading events along with consuming from any given offset. It also supports acking and error handling where appropiate.

Events also different from the broker in that it provides a fixed Event type where you fill in the details and handle the decoding of the message body yourself. Events could have large payloads so we don't want to unnecessarily decode where you may just want to hand off to a storage system.

#### Functions

The events package has two parts: Stream and Store. Stream is used to Publish and Consume to messages for a given topic. For example, in a chat application one user would Publish a message and another whould subscribe. If you later needed to retrieve messages, you could either replay them using the Subscribe function and passing the Offset option, or list them using the Read function.

```go
func Publish(topic string, msg interface{}, opts ...PublishOption) error 
```

The Publish function has two required arguments: topic and message. Topic is the channel you're publishing the event to, in the case of a chat application this would be the chat id. The message is any struct, e.g. the message being sent to the chat. When the subscriber receives the event they'll be able to unmarshal this object. Public has two supported options, WithMetadata to pass key/value pairs and WithTimestamp to override the default timestamp on the event.

```go
func Consume(topic string, opts ...ConsumeOption) (<-chan Event, error)
```

The Consume function is used consume events. In the case of a chat application, the client would pass the chat ID as the topic, and any event published to the stream will be sent to the event channel. Event has an Unmarshal function which can be used to access the message payload, as demonstrated below:

```go
for {
	evChan, err := events.Consume(chatID)
	if err != nil {
		logger.Error("Error subscribing to topic %v: %v", chatID, err)
		return err
	}
	for {
		ev, ok := <- evChan
		if !ok {
			break
		}
		var msg Message
		if err :=ev.Unmarshal(&msg); err != nil {
			logger.Errorf("Error unmarshaling event %v: %v", ev.ID, err)
			return err
		}
		logger.Infof("Received message: %v", msg.Subject)
	}
}
```

### Network

The network is a service to service network for request proxying

#### Overview

The network provides a service to service networking abstraction that includes proxying, authentication, tenancy isolation and makes use of the existing service discovery and routing system. The goal here is not to provide service mesh but a higher level control plane for routing that can govern access based on the existing system. The network requires every service to be pointed to it, making an explicit choice for routing.

Beneath the covers cilium, envoy and other service mesh tools can be used to privde a highly resilient mesh.

### Registry

The registry is a service directory and endpoint explorer

#### Overview

The service registry provides a single source of truth for all services and their APIs. All services on startup will register their name, version, address and endpoints with registry service. They then periodically re-register to "heartbeat", otherwise being expired based on a pre-defined TTL for 90 seconds.

The goal of the registry is to allow the user to explore APIs and services within a running system. The simplest form of access is the below command to list services.

```bash
micro services
```

### Runtime

#### Overview

The runtime service is responsible for running, updating and deleting binaries or containers (depending on the platform - eg. binaries locally, pods on k8s etc) and their logs.

#### Running a service

The `micro run` command tells the runtime to run a service. The following are valid examples:

```bash
micro run github.com/micro/services/helloworld
micro run .  # deploy local folder to your local micro server
micro run ../path/to/folder # deploy local folder to your local micro server
micro run helloworld # deploy latest version, translates to micro run github.com/micro/services/helloworld or your custom base url
micro run helloworld@9342934e6180 # deploy certain version
micro run helloworld@branchname  # deploy certain branch
micro run --name helloworld .
```
